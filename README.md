# Natural_Language_Processing_Course_Project
A Survey on Named Entity Recognition Methods Across Domain-specific Applications

Course Project for Natural Language Processing (CS7650)
Conducted a survey on work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) focusing on challenging research directions in the field, such as semi-supervised deep learning approaches to limited labeled data in NER, challenges in domain-specific NER, and NER on noisy text in Tweets.
